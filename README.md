## üìå Project title 
üìä **Amazon sales data analyis**

##  üìÇ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing product data from Amazon's marketplace to uncover patterns in pricing, discounts, ratings, patterns, customer engagement, and category insights. Using Excel's Pivot Tables, Power Query, and custom formulas, I transformed and visualized the data to extract insights that can guide strategic decisions in product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. 

## üìÅ Dataset Description
The dataset contains information scraped from Amazon product pages, including: 
- Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings 
 - Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content 
 - Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values

**Total Records: 	1,465 rows**       
**Total Fields: 16 columns** 

## Data Preparation Cleaning and Transformation
Before analysis, the following transformations were done in Power Query and Excel:
 - Extracting the main category from multi-level category strings
 - Creating a Conditional Column; price bucket and Customn column; Potential Revenue Column
 - Removing duplicate entries and addressing missing vakues through Excel's data validation and filtering tools
 - Standardizing data formats and converting currency values to consistent unit
   
## üõ† Tools & Techniques Used
- üìå **Excel Features:**
  - Pivot Tables (with Distinct Count)
  - Power Query Editor (for transformation)
  - Slicers for interactivity
  - Conditional formatting

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

Based on the analysis conducted, here are key recommendations to guide strategic decisions:

1. **Focus on High-Performing Categories**  
   Categories like **Electronics** and **Computers & Accessories** generate the most potential revenue and should receive prioritized marketing and inventory investment.

2. **Optimize Discount Strategies**  
   Products with discounts above **50%** are common in certain categories. Instead of broad discounts, apply **targeted discounting** to underperforming products or to clear inventory while preserving margins.

3. **Encourage More Customer Reviews**  
   Many products have fewer than **1,000 reviews**, which may limit visibility and trust. Implement **post-purchase review prompts** or incentives to increase engagement.

4. **Upsell Premium Products**  
   Products priced above ‚Çπ500, although fewer in number, contribute significantly to revenue. Consider upselling and bundling strategies to maximize value per customer.

6. **Refine Product Listing Based on Rating Performance**  
   Low-rated products (<3.0) may damage brand credibility. Either **improve product quality** or **consider delisting** poorly performing items.

7. **Use Price Buckets for Targeted Campaigns**  
   Segment users based on price preferences (e.g., budget: `<‚Çπ200`, mid-range: `‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500`, premium: `>‚Çπ500`) and align advertising and product recommendations accordingly.
